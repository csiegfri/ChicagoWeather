Also weekly problem when stylesheet complete

including a folder and background image


DONE
Get rid of the unnecessary amount of variables in index.js. No longer needed thanks to new format

stop using var dang it - DONE

convert the wind direction ifs to switches - Decided that Switch just wont work

Find better way to utilize the data? Not in table, but in some other type of display. - Cut down on some columns

Remove the github folder, and move all contents into ChicagoWeather proper

Once finalized with that, work on the stylesheet - Need to pull and see how it functions
