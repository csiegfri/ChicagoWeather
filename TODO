Get rid of the unnecessary amount of variables in index.js. No longer needed thanks to new format

Remove the github folder, and move all contents into ChicagoWeather proper

stop using var dang it

convert the wind direction ifs to switches

Find better way to utilize the data? Not in table, but in some other type of display. (Probably cut down on some rows)

Once finalized with that, work on the stylesheet

Also weekly problem when stylesheet complete
